### Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun and interesting optimization techniques in deep learning. It merges two images, namely: a <strong>"content" image (C)</strong> and a <strong>"style" image (S)</strong>, to create a <strong>"generated" image (G)</strong>. The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. 

We will use the following image of ancient city of Persepois as the concent image:

<img  src="images/Persepolis.jpg" style="width:430px;height:320px;">

We also use the style of the following paint, as the style image.

<img src="images/style1.jpg" style="width:230px;height:320px;">


The result is pretty cool!


<img src="output/image_5000.jpg" style="width:430px;height:320px;">
